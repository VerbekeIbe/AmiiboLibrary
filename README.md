# AmiiboLibrary

This was a small personal project inspired by Polish developer [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17). I wanted to use a Public CORS-API to display a list of ‘something’ (e.g. movies, songs, comics, …). I chose this Amiibo API because it seemed fun to go to town with Nintendo’s very recognizable style and color scheme. The main focus here was to deliver a clean interface that still gave all the necessary information and make it as responsive as possible.


If I ever find the time I might add a detail page for every Amiibo figure, and maybe get the search bar to actually work. But for now I’m pretty satisfied with this proof of concept.

Make sure to visit the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/VerbekeIbe/AmiiboLibrary/wiki) to learn more about the techniques used in this project.
